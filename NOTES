Request pattern

on request:
  look up in oracle 
  if not has enough data:
    proxy request with "MAYBE BOT" header
    add request response into pattern oracle
    return response
  
  generate response from oracle
  send response



send traffic from nginx based on some rules to liebot
  transparently start thwarting bots

start saving aspects of a request into SVM to automatically classify? some statistical model?
